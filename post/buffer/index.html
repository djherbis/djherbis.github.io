<p>Buffering is useful for a lot of projects, however every task has different requirements and therefore deserves it&rsquo;s own buffering strategy.</p>

<p>Buffering in its simplest form is easy, store some bytes which will be read later. It gets harder when you start adding limited resources and other contraints to the problem.</p>

<p>Buffering can be divided into two categories: Bounded &amp; Unbounded.</p>

<h2 id="bounded-buffering:6f2d919846b8f26e0452180dbb27ffcc">Bounded Buffering</h2>

<p>Bounded buffers are much safer since you can control how much of your resources they take up, however you need to decide what happens to your dataflows when they do.</p>

<h3 id="blocking-buffers:6f2d919846b8f26e0452180dbb27ffcc">Blocking Buffers</h3>

<p>The simplest answer here is: block until there&rsquo;s room. In this case you are guarenteed not to lose data, however Write&rsquo;s to the buffer will block until some data is Read.</p>

<p>However there are cases where blocking isn&rsquo;t what you want. Sometimes losing data is better than clogging the pipe.</p>

<h3 id="non-blocking-buffers:6f2d919846b8f26e0452180dbb27ffcc">Non-Blocking Buffers</h3>

<p>Overflow: data coming in is thrown away when the buffer is full.
Ring: the oldest data in the buffer is thrown away to make room for newer data.</p>

<h2 id="unbounded-buffering:6f2d919846b8f26e0452180dbb27ffcc">Unbounded Buffering</h2>

<p>Unbounded buffers are almost never a good idea, because in reality we never have unlimited resources on which to store them. However I didn&rsquo;t want to preclude users from being able to shoot themselves in the foot if their boss asks them too so I&rsquo;ve included ways to create buffers which can grow forever.</p>
