      <description>I like the simplicity behind boltdb however constantly converting your structs to and from an []byte can introduce a lot of extra code. So I created stow. Stow wraps a bucket in your boltdb database so that it works a little bit more like a map. Stow can use any encoding for storing your data, which will be transparently encoded/decoded when you Put, Get or Pull from your Store. Json, Xml, and Gob (which includes Binary) encodings are built-in and use the stdlib, but feel free to implement your own Codec.</description>
